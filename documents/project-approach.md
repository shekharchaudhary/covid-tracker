# Project Approach for "Covid Compass"

1. Project Planning and Analysis

   - Requirement Analysis: Review and confirm the project requirements, including data types and user interface elements.
   - API Study: Familiarize with The COVID Tracking Project's API, understanding its structure, limitations, and data format.
   - Technology Stack Selection: Choose the appropriate technologies for front-end (e.g., React, Typescript), data visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js).

2. Design Phase

   - UI/UX Design: Create wireframes and mockups for the user interface, focusing on the form and data visualization sections.
   - Data Flow Diagram: Map out how data will be fetched, processed, and displayed.
   - Architecture Design: considering how it will interact with the front-end and the API. Focus on data visualization, user centric design and interactive.

3. Development Setup

   - Version Control Setup: Initialize a Git repository and set up branch management strategies.
   - Project Skeleton: Set up the basic project structure aligning with the chosen technology stack.
   - CI/CD Pipeline Setup: Configure a basic continuous integration and deployment pipeline.

4. Front-End Development

   - Form Development: Develop the form for state/territory selection and data filters.
   - API Integration: Implement functionality to dynamically construct API requests based on form input.
   - Data Visualization: Develop the logic for data visualization, integrating chosen libraries.

5. Testing

   - Unit Tests: Write unit tests for individual components and functions.
   - Integration Tests: Test the integration between different parts of the application.
   - End-to-End Tests: Simulate user scenarios to test the application as a whole.

6. Quality Assurance and User Feedback

   - User Testing: Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on usability.
   - Performance Optimization: Optimize performance based on test results, focusing on load times and responsiveness.
   - Accessibility Checks: Ensure the application meets web accessibility standards.

7. Maintenance and Iteration

   - Feedback Incorporation: Continuously improve the application based on user feedback and analytics.
   - Feature Updates: Plan for future feature additions or updates based on user needs and technological advancements.

8. Documentation
   - Code Documentation: Ensure all code is well-documented for future maintainability.
   - User Guides: Create user guides or help sections for end-users.
